## Series description

The RESOURCEFUL workshop series is an active research initiative that aims to bring attention to the problems of applying computational and linguistic tools for the collection, analysis, and application of resources such as text corpora or other modalities. The initiative brings together researchers from the fields of natural language processing, linguistics, and computational linguistics, who are interest

## Previous editions

[The first workshop](https://gu-clasp.github.io/resourceful-2020/) focused on the size of the resources available for natural language processing. It was co-located with [the 8th Swedish Language Technology Conference (SLTC)](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/en/sltc2020), University of Gothenburg, Sweden.

[The second iteration of the workshop](https://resourceful-workshop.github.io/resourceful-2023/) explored the role of the kind and the quality of resources that are available to us and challenges and directions for constructing new resources in light of the latest trends in natural language processing. It was co-located with [the 24th Nordic Conference on Computational Linguistics (NoDaLiDa)](https://www.nodalida2023.fo/nodalida-2023-tórshavn-faroe-islands), Tórshavn, Faroe Islands.

The next edition of the workshop is planned to focus on data-driven and expert-based types of resources in light of the dominance of the former in natural language processing and computational linguistics in general and the increasing interest in expert-annotated resources. We are particularly interested in how the two can be brought together to computationally solve linguistic problems for different languages.
